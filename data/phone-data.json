      "notes": "Sony's typical trend of making the best compact smartphone continues with the Xperia XZ1 Compact.  Despite the dated design, if you're looking for a compact yet powerful Android phone, the XZ1 is the best bet.  It has the Snapdragon 835, a healthy 4 GB of RAM, plenty of storage with micro SD card expandability and one of the first phones with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box.  Sony cameras have typically been weak the past few iterations despite the big megapixel count, but if you need a phone that can be used easily in one hand, then consider this one when it comes out.
